1. What is a data type in Java?

Answer: A data type in Java is a classification that specifies which type of data a variable can hold.

2. What are the two main categories of data types in Java?

Answer: The two main categories of data types in Java are primitive data types and reference data types.

3. How are primitive data types different from reference data types in Java?

Answer: Primitive data types store simple values, while reference data types store references or addresses to objects.

Doubt Question: In java if I have a variable with Integer data type, will it store the object or the address of the object?

ChatGpt Answer: In Java, if you have a variable with the Integer data type (i.e., the wrapper class for the primitive int), the variable stores a reference (address) to the Integer object, not the object itself.

Here’s a breakdown:
int is a primitive type, and variables of type int store the actual value.

Integer is a reference type (class), so variables of type Integer store a reference to an object of type Integer, not the actual value itself.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Integer a = 100;
Here, a holds a reference (internally, it's like a memory address) pointing to an Integer object that contains the value 100.

Extra detail: Integer Caching
For performance, Java caches Integer objects between -128 and 127. So:

java
Copy
Edit
Integer x = 100;
Integer y = 100;
System.out.println(x == y); // true, because of caching
But:

java
Copy
Edit
Integer x = 200;
Integer y = 200;
System.out.println(x == y); // false, because different objects

4. What is the purpose of declaring a variable in Java?

Answer: Declaring a variable in Java reserves memory to store data and associates a name with the memory location.

5. What is the syntax for declaring a variable in Java?

Answer: The syntax for declaring a variable is: data_type variable_name;

6. Give an example of declaring an integer variable in Java.

Answer: Example: int myNumber;

7. What is the purpose of initializing a variable in Java?

Answer: Initializing a variable assigns an initial value to the variable, allowing it to be used in calculations and operations.

8. What is the syntax for initializing a variable in Java?

Answer: The syntax for initializing a variable is: data_type variable_name = initial_value;

9. Give an example of declaring and initializing a double variable in Java.

Answer: Example: double pi = 3.14159;

10. What is the difference between ‘int’ and ‘double’ data types in Java, and when would you use each?

Answer: ‘int’ is used for storing integer values, and ‘double’ is used for storing floating-point (decimal) values. Use ‘int’ for whole numbers and ‘double’ for numbers with fractions.

 

11. What are the eight primitive data types in Java?

Answer: The eight primitive data types in Java are byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.

12. What is the maximum value that can be stored in a ‘byte’ variable in Java?

Answer: The maximum value for a ‘byte’ variable is 127.

13. What is the difference between ‘float’ and ‘double’ data types in Java, and when would you use each?

Answer: ‘float’ is a single-precision floating-point data type, and ‘double’ is a double-precision floating-point data type. 
Use ‘float’ when you need to save memory, and ‘double’ when you need higher precision.

Doubt Question: What is single precision and what is double precision?
ChatGpt Answer: In computing, precision refers to how accurately a number can be represented, especially for floating-point (decimal) numbers.

✅ Single Precision (float)
Uses 32 bits (4 bytes) of memory.

Precision: About 7 decimal digits.

Syntax: float x = 3.14f; ← Notice the f at the end.

Used when:

1. Memory is limited (like in embedded systems or mobile).

2. Perfect accuracy isn’t critical.

✅ Double Precision (double)
Uses 64 bits (8 bytes) of memory.

Precision: About 15–16 decimal digits.

Syntax: double y = 3.14; ← No suffix needed.

Used when:

1. You need more precision (e.g., scientific calculations, financial apps).

2. Performance isn’t hindered by the extra memory.

14. Explain the ‘char’ data type in Java, and how are characters represented?

Answer: The ‘char’ data type is used to store a single Unicode character. Characters are represented using single quotes, e.g., ‘A’.

15. What is the default value for a ‘boolean’ variable in Java?

Answer: The default value for a ‘boolean’ variable is ‘false’.

16. What is the ‘null’ value, and in which data types can it be used in Java?

Answer: ‘null’ represents the absence of a value and can be assigned to reference data types like objects and strings.

Doubt Question: what is the datatype of null and Do we have a wrapper class NULL?
ChatGptAnswer: ✅ null can be assigned to any object reference.

❌ No NULL wrapper class exists in Java.

⚠️ Use null carefully to avoid NullPointerException!

Comparison	Safe with null?	What it checks
s == null	✅ Yes	Is s pointing to nothing
s.equals(x)	❌ No	Will throw NullPointerException if s == null
"value".equals(s)	✅ Yes	Compares safely, returns false if s is null

String s = null;
System.out.println(Objects.equals(s, "hello")); // ✅ false, no exception

 public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }

17. How do you declare a constant variable in Java, and what is the naming convention for constants?

Answer: Constants are declared using the ‘final’ keyword, and naming conventions typically use uppercase letters with underscores, e.g., final int MAX_VALUE = 100;.

18. What is a variable’s scope in Java, and how does it affect where the variable can be used?

Answer: Variable scope defines where in the code the variable is accessible. Variables can have local, instance, or class scope.

19. What is the lifetime of a local variable in Java?

Answer: Local variables exist only within the block or method where they are declared and have a shorter lifetime compared to instance or class variables.

20. What is variable shadowing, and how does it occur in Java?

Answer: Variable shadowing occurs when a local variable has the same name as an instance or class variable, making the local variable take precedence in that scope.

21. What is type casting in Java, and when is it required?

Answer: Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another. It is required when you need to assign a value from one type to another, such as from a ‘double’ to an ‘int’.
